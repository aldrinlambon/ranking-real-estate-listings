# Ranking Real Estate Listings

## Project Motivation
For this project, I want to create a model to evaluate property listings based on different characteristics and better understand:
1. What are the most common characteristics of sold properties?
2. What are the factors that are highly related to pricing?
3. How are geographical variables affect the probability of a property being sold?

## Data Source / Web Scraping
Due to the API limitations and data availability, I created a python application to scrape listing from [Zillow.com](https://www.zillow.com/). 

I will not provide code for my web scraper. But if you are interested in building one here's the [Repo by maksimKorzh](https://github.com/maksimKorzh/one-time-scrapers/tree/master/scrapers/zillow) that I used as the basis for my initial codes.
